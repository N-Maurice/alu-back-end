These files are projects related to managing and exporting task data for employees. They involve collecting task records, including usernames, task titles, and completion statuses, and formatting this data into a JSON structure. The JSON output organizes tasks under each user ID, providing a detailed list of tasks with their respective completion states.
The document provided instructions for modifying a Python script to export task data of employees into a JSON format. The JSON structure should group tasks by user ID, with each entry containing the username, task title, and completion status. An example JSON output demonstrates how multiple employees' tasks are organized within this format. The overall goal is to generate a comprehensive JSON file that records all tasks from all employees in a structured way, saved as "todo_all_employees.json".
